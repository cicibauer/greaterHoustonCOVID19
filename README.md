# Impact of COVID-19 to Greater Houston Area and Texas

## Project Intro/Objective
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) novel coronavirus has created a path of death, healthcare chaos, and economic instability as it has ravaged the globe as a pandemic. In this project we focus on the Greater Houston Area and Texas to develop data visualization tools and modeling techniques to understand the COVID-19 impact on our local communities(see here a similar project for City of San Jose in CA http://bay.stanford.edu/covid19). We consider and integrate data fromreported COVID-19 cases, social distancing metric, and various socioeconomic status variables, and use data-driven approach to assist policy making.
